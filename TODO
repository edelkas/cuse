TODO:

Backend:
- Extra filters: start date, end date, start ID, end ID, 0th owner, full/empty/X
  leaderboard,...
- Create cache system, storing userlevel files in a big binary / memory, using a
  hash encoding all search query terms to determine if that query is cached or not.
  Store date of cache blocks to allow for expiring of old blocks.
- Make program check Github regularly for new versions, possibly even auto-update.

Frontend:
- Search tabs, so that multiple searches can be juggled (obviously, only one can
  be active at any poiny).
- Ability to save/load previous searches.
- As an alternative, have a CLI + Enter option to execute searches.

Outte:
- Create new field in UserlevelData table of outte's db to contain the Zlibbed block
  and header, ready to be dumped in the final file, for efficiency.

INVESTIGATE:
- What happens when you switch userlevel tabs very quickly? (sockets closing, etc).
- Look into N++'s userlevel cache, perhaps we can disable it.
